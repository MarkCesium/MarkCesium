# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**I'm a python web developer.**
However, my interests are not limited to web development and python development

## About repositories ðŸ’¾
Here you can see my projects, experiments, drafts, projects with me, etc.

## My tech stack ðŸ¤“
I often use the **Python** as my primary programming language in my projects, but often one language is not enough to write a project, so I use different programming languages such as:
- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**
- **HTML** and **CSS**
- **C++/C** (embedded development)
  
My primary **technology stack** when building web applications in python:
- **FastAPI** (with **Pydantic**)
- **SQLAlchemy** (with **Alembic**)
- **PostgreSQL**

But I also have experience developing a web application on PHP framework **Symfony**

I also use the following libraries during development: 
- **Aiogram**
- **Aiohttp**
- **Jinja2**
- **BeautifulSoup4**
- **Web3**
- etc.

My frontend development experience includes the following technologies:
- **React/Knockout.js**
- **jQuery**
- **Chart.js**
- **WebSockets**
- **Tailwind/Bootstrap**
