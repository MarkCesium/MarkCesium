# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**I am a developer interested in building web applications using the Python programming language.**
However, my interest is not limited to web development and using Python only

## About repositories ðŸ’¾
Here you can see my projects, projects with me, my experiments, drafts, etc.

## My tech stack ðŸ¤“
I often use the **Python** as my primary programming language in my projects, but often one language is not enough to write a project, so I use different programming languages and technologies such as:
- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**
- **HTML** and **CSS**

When developing in the Python programming language, I use the following frameworks and libraries: 
- **FastAPI**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **Alembic**
- **Aiogram**
- etc.

My experience with JavaScript technologies includes the following frameworks and libraries:
- **Knockout.js**
- **React.js**
- **jQuery**
- **Chart.js**

I usually use this programming language when creating the client side of the application, where the following technologies I have worked with are also required: Bootstrap, Tailwind

#### âš¡ I have experience developing on the PHP framework **Symfony**.

## See you later!
